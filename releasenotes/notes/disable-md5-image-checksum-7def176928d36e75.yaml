features:
  - |
    The ``ironic-python-agent`` will now attempt to determine a checksum type
    by evaluating the length of the supplied checksum. This allows SHA512
    (SHA-2) and SHA256 (SHA-2) checksums to be identified and utilized without
    an explicit declaration of the checksum type utilizing the
    ``os_hash_algo`` value.
upgrade:
  - |
    MD5 support for checksums have been disabled by default. This may result
    in rebulids or manual deploy attempts to fail if no updated checksum has
    been supplied for the ``os_hash_value`` and ``os_hash_algo`` settings.
    To re-enable MD5 support, you may utilize a the ``[DEFAULT]md5_enabled``
    setting.
deprecations:
  - |
    Support for MD5 checksums have been deprecated and disabled by default.
    Support for MD5 checksums will be removed after the 2024 Release.
